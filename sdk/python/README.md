# Pulumi GitHub Credentials

This project provides a multi-language Pulumi component that simplifies managing credentials for cloud providers on GitHub. It helps developers create secrets, grant access to developers, and handle other related tasks with ease. This is supposed to be opinionated and build upon the best practices of GitHub and the cloud providers supported.

**Note**: This project is still in its early stages and is not ready for production use.
